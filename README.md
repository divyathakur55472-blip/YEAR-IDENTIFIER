✨ Helping Students Understand Time, One Year at a Time! ✨

Have you ever wondered how many children struggle just to figure out which century a year belongs to? Or how confusing historical timelines can be?

That’s why I created Year Identifier – a simple Python tool that lets anyone input a year and instantly know its century. 🎯

This project is more than just code; it’s about making learning fun, easy, and accessible. Perfect for students, educators, or anyone curious about dates and timelines.

💡 Features:

Input any 4-digit year and get its century instantly.

Beginner-friendly Python code.

Can be integrated into larger educational projects.

I hope this small tool can make a big difference for learners everywhere. Your feedback, stars ⭐, and contributions are always welcome!
